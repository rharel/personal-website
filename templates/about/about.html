        I'm a computer scientist with interests overlapping fields such as psychology,
        sociology, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I received a bachelor's of computer science & engineering from the
        <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a> in 2014,
        and more recently I graduated from the Game and Media Technology master program at
        <a href="http://www.uu.nl/en" target="_blank">Utrecht University</a> in the Netherlands.
        My thesis' work is about modeling multi-modal, multi-party conversation. My long-term goal
        is to conduct research on computer-aided mental therapy, or something similar in another
        branch of medicine.

        This website serves to host, document and showcase a multitude
        of <a href="/projects/">side-projects</a> I've made in my spare time.

        Best, <br>
